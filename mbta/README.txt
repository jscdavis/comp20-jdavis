Part 1: James Davis - Lab 9

Every aspect of the lab has been implemented and is working properly. I'm still experimenting with the best train google map icons to use, but the ones I have now are functional. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment but I did take some code from the gmap_api_example to get started with a working Google Maps API, but then I did my own edits from there. This lab took me about 6 hours.

Part 2: James Davis - Lab 10

- I was able to determine and mark the user's location on the map
- I was able to write a set of functions that were supposed to return the closest station and the distance away, but I couldn't fix the errors. However I was able to get the infowindow to open when the marker was clicked on.
- I wrote code to map a blue polyline from the user's location to the nearest station, but because I couldn't get the functions to work, the line failed to be mapped.
- I failed to complete code for displaying an infowindow with the train schedules for each station. The two issues I ran into: 1) I didn't know how to code something such that whenever ANY marker was clicked (rather than a specific one), a XMLHTTPRequest was made. 2) I didn't know how to pass in name of the station the user was clicking on, so as to match it to the correct station in the JSON data.
I did not collaborate with anyone on this lab. I spent approximately 6 hours on this lab.
