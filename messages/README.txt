James Davis - Lab 7
All aspects of the lab have been implemented and are functioning properly. I asked my friend Matt (a student at the University of Rochester) about Javascript syntax, and he helped me realize that I was putting the index brackets in the wrong place. I spent about 1 hour on this lab.
